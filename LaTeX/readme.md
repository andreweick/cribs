-- mactex::basic maybe not sufficient (following this discussion: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/multimarkdown/alrd5fjaMHo)

-- I don't think pandoc is required for the compilation.

-- Install full MacTeX from here: http://tug.org/mactex/
-- There is a small instruction at the very beginning of every .tex file to run xelatex instead of pdflatex to get the desired result.
-- Means you have to run (hopefully, because I usually use GUI programs) xelatex filename.tex
-- The GUI program I'm using on my Windows PC is texmaker, also available for Mac OS X from here: http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html#macosx
-- I heard about TeXShop editor as a very popular LaTeX editor for OS X. you can check this for more info: https://discussions.apple.com/message/18653515#18653515
